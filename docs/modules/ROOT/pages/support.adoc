= Support

RuboCop currently has several official & unofficial support channels.
For questions, suggestions, and support refer to one of them.

NOTE: Please, don't use the support channels to report issues, as this makes them
harder to track.

== Gitter

Most internal discussions about the development of RuboCop happen on its
https://gitter.im/bbatsov/rubocop[gitter channel]. You can often find
RuboCop's maintainers there and get some interesting news from the project's
kitchen.

== Mailing List

The https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/rubocop[official mailing list] is
hosted at Google Groups. It's a low-traffic list, so don't be too hesitant to subscribe.

== Freenode

If you're into IRC you can visit the `#rubocop` channel on Freenode.
It's not actively
monitored by the RuboCop maintainers themselves, but still you can get support
from other RuboCop users there.

== StackOverflow

We're also encouraging users to ask RuboCop-related questions on StackOverflow.

When doing so you should use the
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/rubocop[RuboCop] tag (ideally combined
with the tag `ruby`).
