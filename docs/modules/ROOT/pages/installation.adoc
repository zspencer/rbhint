= Installation

RuboCop's installation is pretty standard:

[source,sh]
----
$ gem install rubocop
----

If you'd rather install RuboCop using `bundler`, don't require it in your `Gemfile`:

[source,rb]
----
gem 'rubocop', require: false
----

RuboCop's development is moving at a very rapid pace and there are
often backward-incompatible changes between minor releases (since we
haven't reached version 1.0 yet). To prevent an unwanted RuboCop update you
might want to use a conservative version locking in your `Gemfile`:

[source,rb]
----
gem 'rubocop', '~> 0.87.1', require: false
----

NOTE: You can check out our progress on the road to version 1.0 https://github.com/rubocop-hq/rubocop/milestone/4[here].
You can also help us get there faster! :-)

.A Modular RuboCop
****
Originally RuboCop bundled cops focused on performance and Ruby on Rails, but those were
extracted into their own gems eventually:

* the performance cops were extracted in `rubocop-performance` and were removed from the main gem in 0.68
* the Ruby on Rails cops were extracted in `rubocop-rails` and were removed from the main gem in 0.72

You'll need to install those gems separately if you'd like to use them.
See https://metaredux.com/posts/2019/05/22/a-modular-rubocop.html[this article] for more details.

Additionally, RuboCop's AST logic was extracted to `rubocop-ast` in RuboCop 0.84. While this change is
transparent to RuboCop's users (`rubocop-ast` is a runtime dependency of `rubocop`), it's good to be
aware that you can leverage RuboCop's AST node extensions and AST node pattern matching outside of RuboCop.
