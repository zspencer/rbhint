**RbHint** is a Ruby static code analyzer (a.k.a. `linter`) and code formatter. Out of the box it
will encourage many of the guidelines outlined in the community [Ruby Style
Guide](https://rubystyle.guide). Apart from reporting the problems discovered in your code,
RbHint can also automatically fix many of them you.

RbHint is extremely flexible and most aspects of its behavior can be tweaked via various
[configuration options](https://github.com/zspencer/rbhint/blob/development/config/default.yml).

## Installation

**RbHint**'s installation is pretty standard:

```sh
$ gem install rbhint
```

If you'd rather install RbHint using `bundler`, add a line for it in your `Gemfile` (but set the `require` option to `false`, as it is a standalone tool):

```rb
gem 'rbhint', require: false
```

RbHint's development is moving at a very rapid pace and there are
often backward-incompatible changes between minor releases (since we
haven't reached version 1.0 yet). To prevent an unwanted RbHint update you
might want to use a conservative version lock in your `Gemfile`:

```rb
gem 'rbhint', '~> 0.85.0', require: false
```

## Quickstart

Just type `rbhint` in a Ruby project's folder and watch the magic happen.

```
$ cd my/cool/ruby/project
$ rbhint
```

## Documentation

RbHint is a feature-for-feature compatible adaptation of RuboCop, with a kindler, gentler approach to encouragingg change. You can read more about how to use RbHint by reading [RuboCop's official docs](https://docs.rubocop.org).

## Compatibility

RbHint supports the following Ruby implementations:

* MRI 2.4+
* JRuby 9.2+
